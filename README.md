BACKGROUND AND NAVIGATION
- Welcome to Songbook! Songbook is a social media website where people can rate, share, and post about music.
- Upon opening the website, you'll be welcomed by 2 pages: register and login. If you already have an account, log in directly. If not, register with a username, password, and profile picture! Usernames must be unique.
- Once signed in, you can create your own posts via the "post" link in the navbar. Each post must indicate the artist, title, and rating (out of 5), along with a caption
- Once you've signed in, you'll automatically be brought to an explore page, displaying every single post a user has made on the website from most to least recent. You can always return to the navigation page via the explore link on the navbar
- You can also view the website's song leaderboard via the navbar, which will rank every single song in order of descending rank. Rank is determined by aggregating all rankings for that song in the website's database.
- The profile tab in the navigation bar allows you to see your own posts, along with the total number of posts you have made
